== Introduction
`[written by Cheng Lit Yaw]`

CoderLifeInsights is a CLI (Command Line Interface) driven desktop application that a programmer can use to record his or her social interactions with individual friends, or group of friends. +
CoderLifeInsights gives the programmer insights into his or her social life, and provides suggestions to liven up their social life by analysing the social events recorded in CoderLifeInsight through the CLI.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `coderlifeinsights.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CoderLifeInsights.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:

* *`list_persons`* : lists all contacts
* **`add_person n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to your Life.
* **`delete_person 2` : deletes the 2rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,`p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

`view INSIGHT_PARAMETER [m/PERSON_INDEX] [g/GROUP_INDEX]`
Note that the application will only accept EITHER a person index OR a group index, never both.
Also, whether an index is required or possibly not allowed depends on the insight parameter.

****
* The available insight parameters are: `places`, `activities`, `recent`, `all`, and `time`.
** `Places` (must enter an index)
*** This function lists all the places that the user has visited with the target person or target group, and their frequencies, in descending order of frequency.
